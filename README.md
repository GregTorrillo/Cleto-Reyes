## Motivation: 
As a big boxing fan, I wanted to create an alternate website for legendary boxing brand, Cleto Reyes. 
	
## Description:
The user is shown an artistic interwoven home page of sections consisting of the three colors of the Mexican flag with animated and interactive products and historical events, as well as sections of boxing legends, Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Manny Pacquiao, and Julio Cesar Chavez, with image sliders displaying promos, boxing champions wearing Cleto Reyes gloves, and handmade craftsman making the gloves.
